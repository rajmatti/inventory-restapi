/*
 *  In an application, the business logic resides within the service layer so 
 *  we use the @Service Annotation to indicate that a class belongs to that layer.
	One most important thing about the @Service Annotation is it can be applied only to classes.
	It is used to mark the class as a service provider.
	So overall @Service annotation is used with classes that provide some
	business functionalities.
	Spring context will autodetect these classes when annotation-based 
	configuration and classpath scanning is used.
	
	@Transactional annotation, which provides broad support for transaction management
	i.e insert, update, select & delete ,and allows developers to concentrate on business
	logic rather than worrying about data integrity in the event of system failures.
